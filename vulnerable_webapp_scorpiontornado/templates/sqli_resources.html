    <h2 class="mb-3">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      SQL injection (SQLI) is a well-known type of injection attack.
      It refers to when an attacker submits maliciously crafted inputs called "payloads" in order to modify the SQL query executed by the web application, and thus exert control over its database.
      This can have disastrous consequences - depending on the severity of the vulnerability, it can allow the attacker to bypass authentication, retrieve, insert, update and delete data.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="mb-3">Prevention</h2>
    <p>
      A naive approach to preventing SQL injection is blacklists - where key SQL keywords (like "SELECT", "UNION", or "1=1") are banned.
      Servers will either refuse to process the query when a blacklisted word is detected, or will strip/replace blacklisted words completely.
      For example, "SELECT * FROM Users" might become "* Users".
      However, blacklists are never 100% effective - there are many ways to bypass blacklists, and it is very easy to forget to blacklist a keyword.
      As with any complex system, there will be bugs, vulnerabilities, and other risks. Its simply impossible to blacklist every possible malicious statement without affecting legitimate users (at least with current technologies and a modest budget)
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many prevention methods that you could (and probably should) use instead. Perhaps the most effective defence mechanism is combining multiple approaches - using "defence in depth".
      If you want to learn more, check out the "Further Reading" section below. For now, I'll introduce one of the simplest and most effective prevention methods - "parameterised statements".
    </p>
    <p>
      A common anti-pattern in cybersecurity is the idea of mixing data and control.
      With SQL injection, the user-inputted data (like their username) can inadvertently be treated as SQL code and impact the control of the system - which is bad!
      Parameterised statements are a way of addressing this by separating the SQL query from the user input.
      Instead of directly inserting the user input into the query (via concatenation or format strings), the user input is treated as a parameter to a function (provided by the database driver, like sqlite3).
      These inputs will then be treated in a safe manner - as data rather than code (like SQL keywords or special characters).
      <strong>You should always use parameterised statements where available, unless you have a really good reason not to.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Here is an example of two different <strong>vulnerable</strong> methods of forming and executing a SQL query with Python and sqlite3, assuming a connection has been set up, and a cursor, <code>cur</code>, has been created:</p>
    <pre><code class="code_block px-0 py-2">
      # Never do either of these - insecure!

      # Vulnerable method 1 - concatenation
      cur.execute("SELECT age FROM Students WHERE firstname='" + firstname + "' AND lastname='" + lastname + "'")

      # Vulnerable method 2 - format strings
      cur.execute(f"SELECT age FROM Students WHERE firstname='{firstname}' AND lastname='{lastname}'")
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      In both of those methods, Python string operations are used to directly insert user input into the SQL query and treated as code.
      This allows attackers to enter malicious payloads to modify the SQL query!
      To avoid this, we can use parameterised statements instead. In sqlite3, the easiest approach is to use placeholders with execute() to bind values in SQL queries, like so:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="code_block px-0 py-2">
      # Do this instead!

      # This qmark style is the simplest, but there are other styles too
      # Would nest the params inside another tuple/list if was using executemany() - one row per statement
      params = ("Bobby", "Tables",)
      cur.execute("SELECT age FROM Students WHERE firstname = ? AND lastname = ?", params)
      print(cur.fetchall())
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      This "qmark style" involving question marks is probably the most straightforward, but there's also a named style if you're having trouble keeping track of which ? corresponds with which variable.
      Both styles also work with executemany() - see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3-placeholders">the docs</a> for more info. Also, it's important to note that each database driver does this slightly differently, so be sure to check out the relevant documentation (searching for "parameterised statements" or "placeholders") if you're actually coding this yourself.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="code_block px-0 py-2">
      # Never do either of these - insecure!

      # Vulnerable method 1 - concatenation
      cur.execute("SELECT username FROM Users WHERE username='" + username + "' AND password='" + password + "'")

      # Vulnerable method 2 - format strings
      cur.execute(f"SELECT username FROM Users WHERE username='{username}' AND password='{password}'")
    </code></pre>
